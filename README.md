## Getting Started 

This project is only available for the web. The FeedReader was built to show the amount of skill obtained by taking the nano-degree course and learning about testing with Jasmine. 

This project will be available on GitHub

## Project Overview 

This is a web-based application that can read RSS feeds. This application has been worked under the file Feedreader.Js to run a various amount of tests that will verify different components on the site are working properly. For more information about these tests please read the *Tests section. 


## Prerequisites 

To install this project, you must simply clone the repository to your desktop. A coding editor is needed for a further review into the code. Use your favorite browser to open the index file. First, start by opening the ./jasmine/spec/feedreader.js and review all the jasmine documentation. Then, open the  ./js/app.j to learn more about the javascript file and to facilitate writing the tests with jasmine. 


## Tests

These are the three most needed test in the application. 


# Test Suite "Initial Entries"

This test is so that when LoadFeed is called and completes all its work there is a single .entry element within the feed container. 


# Test Suite "New Feed Selection"

This test is to make that when a new feed is loaded the content actually changes. 


# Test Suite "The Menu"

This test ensures that the menu is hidden when the website is loaded. Also, It verifies that when the menu icon is clicked the menu toggles on and off.
